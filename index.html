    <p class="first">Three years ago, Justin Bieber appeared on the cover of COMPLEX as a fresh-faced 18-year-old. At the time, he was a relatively unblemished teen pop idol—so of course we photographed him in a boxing ring, bloodied and bruised (the blood was fake; the steak he held against his face was not). In the ensuing years, Bieber took his share of lumps: a bad breakup, multiple run-ins with the law, a night in jail for DUI and drag racing, and some head-scratching antics caught on camera, including an infamously belligerent deposition and peeing into a mop bucket. Depending on who you ask, Bieber had either gone full “bad boy” or was simply dealing with the growing pains associated with being a handsome, fabulously wealthy post-adolescent.</p>
